# Internationalization

The underlying libraries to provide internationalization to the application is [i18next](https://www.i18next.com/).

## Usage

Supported languages and the default one are defined in [src/utils/i18n/constants.ts](../../src/utils/i18n/constants.ts).

Translations are provided from [locales](../../src/locales/).

Methods are provided to change the language from both the renderer and the main process:

From the renderer:

```ts
import { changeLang } from '@/utils/i18n';

changeLang(lang);
```

From the main process:

```ts
import { changeLang } from '@/utils/i18n/main';

changeLang(lang);
```

## Architecture

The main process and the renderer both have different i18n objects (as they are different processes) sharing the common configuration between them.

To provide a safe environment, there's no direct communication between them and instead everything is done through IPC channels.
